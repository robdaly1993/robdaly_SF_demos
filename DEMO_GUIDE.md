## üé® Visualization Tips

### Request Charts Explicitly
Always ask for visualizations when comparing data:

- "Plot this as a line chart"
- "Create a trend line"
- "Visualize this comparison"

### Best Chart Types by Question

| Question Type | Best Chart | Example |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| Trend over time | Line chart | "Monthly viewability trend" |
| Compare categories | Bar chart | "Viewability by publisher" |
| Part of whole | Pie chart | "Impressions by channel" |
| Two metric comparison | Scatter plot | "CPM vs Viewability" |
| Distribution | Histogram | "Distribution of fraud rates" |

**Pro Tip**: Add "with a chart" to any question to get a visualization!

## ‚ö° Pro Tips

### 1. Be Specific with Time Ranges
‚úÖ **Good**: "Show viewability for Q1 2025"  
‚ùå **Vague**: "Show viewability" (defaults to all data)

### 2. Request Visualizations
‚úÖ **Good**: "Plot this as a chart"  
‚úÖ **Good**: "Show me a bar chart visualization"

### 3. Combine Multiple Metrics
‚úÖ **Good**: "Show viewability AND fraud rate by publisher"  
‚úÖ **Good**: "Compare CPM, CTR, and viewability rate"

### 4. Use Natural Language
‚úÖ **Good**: "Which publishers are the worst for fraud?"  
‚úÖ **Good**: "What's our best performing campaign?"  
‚ùå **Bad**: Don't use SQL syntax!

### 5. Iterate on Responses
- **Start broad**: "Show campaign performance"
- **Then drill down**: "Now show that just for Mobile"
- **Refine further**: "And filter to Q4 only"

### 6. Use Web Scraping Strategically
‚úÖ When you need external benchmarks  
‚úÖ To research competitor features  
‚úÖ For industry standards/definitions  
‚ùå Don't scrape data you already have internally

### 7. Check Your Documents First
Before web scraping, try: "What do our policies say about [topic]?"

## üî• Most Impressive Demo Moments

### 1. Real-Time Competitive Intelligence
```
You: "Go to IAS website and compare their fraud detection claims to our actual fraud rates"

Agent: *Scrapes site, analyzes data, compares metrics*

Result: "IAS claims 0.1% fraud detection capability. Our current fraud rate 
is 0.18%, slightly higher but within acceptable range per our internal policy 
which sets threshold at 0.3%..."
```

### 2. Policy Compliance Validation
```
You: "Check our brand safety policy for acceptable thresholds, then show me 
which publishers exceed those limits"

Agent: *Searches policy docs, queries data, cross-references*

Result: "Your brand safety policy sets 0.5% unsafe threshold. Analysis shows:
- NewsNow.com: 0.7% (EXCEEDS by 0.2%)
- SportDaily.com: 0.9% (EXCEEDS by 0.4%)
Recommendation: Review contracts or implement blocking..."
```

### 3. Industry Benchmarking Analysis
```
You: "Find CTV AVOC benchmarks online and tell me if we're above or below 
industry standard"

Agent: *Scrapes industry report, compares to internal data*

Result: "Industry benchmark for premium CTV is 55% AVOC (source: MediaRadar 
Q4 2024). Your CTV AVOC rate is 48%, approximately 7 points below premium 
threshold. Top performing CTV publisher: CTVNetwork at 52% AVOC..."
```

### 4. Multi-Source Analysis
```
You: "Research typical programmatic fraud rates, check our policy thresholds, 
then show which exchanges exceed both benchmarks"

Agent: *Web scrape ‚Üí doc search ‚Üí data query*

Result: "Industry fraud benchmark: 0.2% (TAG standards). Your policy threshold: 
0.3%. Exchange analysis:
- All exchanges meet your policy
- 4 of 5 meet industry benchmark
- Index Exchange at 0.25% slightly above industry average..."
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"No data found"** | Add time range: "for 2025" or "last 30 days" |
| **Agent seems confused** | Rephrase more simply. Break into smaller questions. |
| **Web scraping fails** | Some sites block scrapers. Try different source. |
| **Wrong metric calculated** | Be explicit: "viewability rate" not just "viewability" |
| **No visualization shown** | Ask: "show this as a chart" or "create a bar chart" |
| **Slow response** | Complex queries take longer. Be patient! |
| **Generic answer** | Add more context: dimensions, time periods, filters |
